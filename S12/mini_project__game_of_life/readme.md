## Rules

> `Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.`
> `Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.`
> `Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.`
> `Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.`
